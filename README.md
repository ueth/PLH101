Welcome to the PLH101 repository. This repository is a comprehensive collection of coursework for the PLH101 Software Engineering course at the Technical University of Crete (TUC). It comprises two main projects, each designed to explore and elucidate various aspects of software engineering, specifically focusing on the design and implementation of software systems in Java.

## Project 1: Project Management System

Located in the `project1` directory, this project involves the design and implementation of a project management system. The system is designed to manage projects, tasks, and employees, providing functionalities such as creating and assigning tasks to employees, and managing projects. The system is implemented in Java and provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

Key Components:

- `IMS.java`: The main class that runs the system.
- `Project.java`, `Task.java`, `Employee.java`, `Manager.java`, `Developer.java`: Classes representing different entities in the system.
- `ProjectManagerCLI.java`: The command-line interface for the system.

## Project 2: Virtual Machine Handler

Located in the `project2` directory, this project involves the design and implementation of a virtual machine handler. The handler is designed to manage a computer cluster and handle the creation and assignment of virtual machines. The system is implemented in Java and provides a command-line interface for user interaction.

Key Components:

- `App.java`: The main class that runs the system.
- `CLI.java`: The command-line interface for the system.
- `Program.java`, `ProgramHandler.java`, `ProgramAssigner.java`: Classes for handling programs.
- `VM.java`, `PlainVM.java`, `VmGPU.java`, `VmNetworked.java`, `VmNetworkedGPU.java`: Classes representing different types of virtual machines.
- `ComputerCluster.java`, `VMHandler.java`: Classes for managing the computer cluster and virtual machines.
